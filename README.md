# kaggletools
Collection of functions not to be used in real projects.
I just use them in my kernels at Kaggle.com to avoid code
duplication and make the code easier to reuse in case I
discover something really good. I think using a small library
with unit tests instead of writing the same data analysis
code in every kernel may help me avoid stupid mistakes.
